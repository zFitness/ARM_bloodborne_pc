// bbport BB_LAYER_MEMORY: the BufferCache side of the layer's memory module
// (gpu/layer/bblayer_gpu_memory.h, docs/MEMORY_MODULE_PLAN.ru.md). The game's memory is bound in
// place through its chunk buffers; blocks of known data (what loaders wrote) get VRAM copies in
// mirrors: one buffer per run of such blocks, runs that meet merged into a new mirror. No sparse
// binding: a move is a copy plus the module's bookkeeping, and bindings pick the source.
//
// Step 3a: only loaded data is copied to VRAM, and a range the GPU writes goes back in place
// first, so the game's memory always holds the current data and readers in place (the huge
// bindings over all memory) stay right.

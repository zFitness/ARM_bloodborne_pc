/* The CPU that runs the game's x86-64 code: the host CPU on x86-64 (src/runtime_cpu.c), FEXCore's
 * JIT elsewhere (cpu/, libbbcpu.so). Guest and host share one address space either way; what
 * differs is how control crosses between them, which goes through these calls:
 *  - host functions handed to the guest (imports) are wrapped by guest_cpu_host_function;
 *  - guest functions called by the host (thread entries, callbacks) go through guest_cpu_call;
 *  - guest register state at a signal is read with guest_cpu_signal_regs. */

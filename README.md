## bbport — a native Linux port of Bloodborne

**English** · [Русский](README.ru.md)

bbport is the counterpart of Wine + DXVK for a single game: *Bloodborne* for PlayStation 4
(CUSA03173, game version 1.09) on an x86-64 Linux PC. The game's original executable runs
directly on the PC:

- **as in Wine**, the game's x86-64 code runs on the CPU directly, and a runtime written for
  this one game replaces the PS4 system libraries;
- **as in DXVK**, the game's graphics are translated to Vulkan — by a renderer derived from
  [shadPS4](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4) and heavily extended for this game, including
  temporal upscaling with AMD FSR 3.1, FSR 4 and FSR 4.1.1;
- memory is moving to the PC model (the experimental memory model: the game's data in system
  RAM, VRAM for what the GPU reads often).

Two steps remain to the full Wine + DXVK model: debug the new memory model and move the rest of
the graphics renderer to translation (see below).

> **No game files are included.** You need your own dump of Bloodborne (CUSA03173, v1.09).
> This project is not affiliated with Sony Interactive Entertainment, FromSoftware or AMD.

**Status: experimental, playable.** The game boots, loads saves and plays (the Hunter's Dream
and several areas of Yharnam were played with it) with sound, gamepad and saving.
A full play-through has not been verified, and only one machine (Linux, AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT,
Mesa/RADV) has been tested thoroughly.

## Highlights

- **Native execution.** The eboot is converted offline into a flat memory image; PS4 libc and
  libSceFios2 are linked into it as native code. No CPU emulation and no per-instruction
  translation: the game code runs at full speed.
- **PC memory model — experimental, off by default.** The game's memory lives in system RAM and
  the GPU reads it where it is, as a PC game's buffers; data it reads often is kept in VRAM and
  given back when unused (textures after 20 s, buffers after 60 s). No page-protection write
  tracking, no copies of the whole GPU-visible memory: faster and fewer stutters. **It has been
  tested only on the author's PC (RX 7800 XT) and a Steam Deck, may crash, and does not work
  properly on NVIDIA** (the driver cannot map the memory as needed; the port then falls back to
  the old model). Turn it on with the launcher's *New memory model (experimental)* switch
  (`BB_GUEST_IN_PLACE=1`). By default the 0.2 model is used: VRAM copies of the game's memory
  with write tracking. Unused textures are freed in both models, so VRAM no longer grows with
  every area visited.
- **Unlocked frame rate.** Community patches (`patches/Bloodborne.xml`) make the simulation
  use the real frame time; ~90 FPS at 4K with FSR 4 Balanced on an RX 7800 XT, ~150 FPS at
  1440p with FSR 4 Quality. Also 30/60/90 FPS modes.
- **Temporal upscaling built for this game.** Bloodborne has no velocity buffer, so bbport
  computes motion vectors itself: camera motion from depth and the scene matrices, and object
  motion (characters, cloth, weapons) from the vertex positions of the previous frame. The
  scene is jittered sub-pixel (Halton) and rendered at a reduced resolution; the upscaler fills
  the output (720p for the Steam Deck, 1080p, 1440p or 2160p) and the UI is drawn natively at the output resolution.
  - **FSR 3.1** (FireBurn/FSR-Vulkan).
  - **FSR 4 (INT8, model v07)** on GPUs exposing the required Vulkan shader features —
    RDNA2/3 included (see Requirements).
  - **FSR 4.1.1 (INT8)**: AMD's 4.1.1 DLL is recorded once under vkd3d-proton and its passes
    are replayed natively on Vulkan; the output is **bit-exact** with the DLL. The assets are
    built on your machine from your own DLLs (`tools/fsr4cap`).
  - Faster than AMD's own shaders on RDNA3: the final passes of FSR 4 and 4.1.1 were rewritten
    to store through workgroup memory (3.5× and 2.3× faster, bit-exact); FSR 4 costs ~4 ms at
    4K on an RX 7800 XT instead of ~6 ms.
- **Multi-threaded GPU command processing.** The PS4 command stream is decoded on one thread
  and draws are bound and recorded on another (two-stage pipeline), with a Vulkan recording
  thread and helper threads for memory copies. Early on the single GPU thread capped the game
  at ~26 FPS; now it runs at 90–150 FPS depending on resolution and scene.
- **In-game menu** (Insert or L3+R3): upscaler, preset, sharpness, output resolution, game
  effects (chromatic aberration, DoF, motion blur, SSAO, the game's own AA, SSR, model LOD).
- **GTK4 launcher** and an **AppImage** for the Steam Deck.

## How it differs from shadPS4

| | shadPS4 | bbport |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | General PS4 emulator, many games | One game: Bloodborne v1.09 |
| Loading | Its own ELF loader and kernel emulation at run time | The eboot is converted offline (`scripts/`) into an image with PS4 libc/Fios2 linked in; a C loader maps it and jumps into the game (loader and runtime: ~5k lines) |
| Memory | The GPU's view of PS4 memory is kept in VRAM copies, synchronized through page-protection write tracking | By default the same model; experimental PC model: the game's memory in system RAM, used by the GPU in place, frequently read data in VRAM, freed when unused |
| System libraries | Broad HLE of the PS4 OS | A small runtime (`src/runtime_*.c`) that implements exactly what Bloodborne calls: memory, threads, sync, files, audio (incl. ATRAC9), pad, saves, AppContent |
| GPU | shadPS4 video core and shader recompiler | The same core (vendored, GPL) with ~200 marked changes (`bbport:`) plus new modules: two-stage draw pipeline, render-state and texture-set memoization, render-scale proxies, motion vectors, FSR 3.1/4/4.1.1, frame capture and GPU profiler |
| GPU thread | One thread processes the whole command stream (the bottleneck in Bloodborne) | Decode and draw recording run on separate threads; the work scales with the hardware threads (Steam Deck included) |
| Upscaling | — | Temporal (FSR 3.1, FSR 4, FSR 4.1.1) with the game's own motion vectors and jitter |
| Game patches | Patch files applied by the emulator | The same community patches, compiled at start (`scripts/patches.py`); render resolution, effects and FPS from the launcher |

Without shadPS4 there would be no bbport: its renderer and shader recompiler are the base of
the graphics side.

### Wine + DXVK for one game

- **CPU.** The PS4 CPU is x86-64, so the game's code runs directly on the PC's CPU, with no
  emulation and no instruction translation.
- **System libraries.** As Wine replaces the Windows API, the bbport runtime (`src/runtime_*.c`)
  implements exactly the PS4 OS functions Bloodborne calls: memory, threads, files, audio, pad,
  saves.
- **Memory.** Moving to the PC model: the game's data in system RAM, VRAM used the way a PC game
  uses it. It is still experimental and needs debugging.
- **Graphics.** For now the shadPS4-derived renderer decodes the PS4 GPU's command stream (PM4)
  and translates its shaders (GCN) to Vulkan — the last part that works the old way. **In the
  next patch it is reworked into DXVK-style translation**: the game's graphics API calls
  (GnmDriver) translated directly into Vulkan, with the shaders translated to SPIR-V, without
  decoding the GPU's command stream.

"Port" here means a build for this one game, not a rewrite of its source code, which the project
neither has nor includes.

## Requirements

- Linux x86-64, a Vulkan 1.3 GPU. Tested: AMD RX 7800 XT with Mesa 26 (RADV).
  FSR 4 / 4.1.1 require shader Float16, Int8/Int16, integer dot products, linear compute
  derivatives and extended storage image formats; FSR 4.1.1 additionally requires
  `VK_VALVE_shader_mixed_float_dot_product`. Unsupported choices fall back to FSR 3.1
  before the first frame and are disabled in the in-game menu.
- Your decrypted game dump: the `CUSA03173` folder (eboot.bin, sce_module, ...), version 1.09.
  A dumped update is a separate folder: copy it over the base game, replacing files. The base
  game alone (1.00) crashes at start (guest offset 0x20348b8); the launcher and `run.sh` check
  the executable and say what is missing (`BB_SKIP_GAME_CHECK=1` skips the check).
- To build: GCC, CMake, Ninja, Python 3, glslang, SDL3, Vulkan headers and the libraries in
  `shell.nix`. With [Nix](https://nixos.org) everything comes from `shell.nix` automatically.

## Build and run

```bash
git clone --recursive <this repository> bbport && cd bbport
bash build.sh                        # builds out/bb-probe and out/gpu/libbbgpu.so
BB_GAME_DIR=/path/to/CUSA03173 bash run.sh
```

or the launcher (pick the game folder, settings, *Start*):

```bash
bash launcher/bb-launcher.sh         # launcher/install-desktop.sh adds it to the app menu
```

By default the game folder is expected next to the repository (`../CUSA03173`). Saves and the
shader cache go to `user/` (the launcher lets you choose another folder); settings to
`bbport.ini`. A gamepad is used through SDL3 (the launcher's *Controls → Controller* picks one
when several are connected; `BB_GAMEPAD=<GUID or part of the name>`); there is a keyboard
fallback. The character name is typed on the keyboard in a box over the game.

**Resolution and preset changes:** for outputs other than 1080p (720p on the Steam Deck,
1440p, 4K) the whole game renders at the preset's resolution, set by a patch at start — the
fastest path. Changing the output or the preset in the in-game menu then needs *Apply and
restart the game*. The *Live resolution changes* setting (launcher, in-game menu,
`bbport.ini` `live_resolution=0|1|auto`; **off by default**) instead keeps the game at
1080p internally and scales its render targets at run time, so 720p/1080p/1440p/4K and the
presets switch without a restart. It costs more: the game then believes it renders 1080p
and draws more (e.g. ~8× more small lights), and some targets are copied between sizes —
use it on strong desktop GPUs only (`auto` turns it on for discrete GPUs with 8+ GB that are
not pre-Turing NVIDIA). 1080p output and TAA always use the live path.

**TAA:** a separate native-resolution temporal AA mode in the launcher and overlay,
switchable live without an FSR model. The saved FSR preset is restored when returning
to FSR. FSR Native AA adds reconstruction on top of full-resolution rendering and can
be slower than disabling AA. TAA also adds work compared with no temporal AA.
The RCAS switch and the 0–2 sharpness control also work with TAA. Sharpening runs after
temporal accumulation and leaves its history and HUD unchanged.

**Mods:** the launcher accepts separate loose-file mod folders (with `dvdroot_ps4/`, an extra
wrapper folder, or the game folders such as `chr/` directly; file name case does not matter),
with enable switches and load order. A sibling `CUSA03173-mods/` overlay also works.
The original game is preserved; later mods override conflicting files.
**Third-party patches:** shadPS4-format XML patch files in the data directory's `patches/`,
switched on and off in the launcher. See [mods and patches](docs/MODS.md).

**Launcher language:** Russian or English (follows the system language by default).

**Free camera and game debug menu** (v1.09): enable the corresponding switches in the
launcher or in-game menu and restart. Free camera uses Lance McDonald's
[GoldHEN patch](https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN_Patch_Repository/blob/main/patches/xml/Bloodborne-Orbis.xml):
hold Cross and press L3 to cycle modes (keyboard: hold Space and press Z). It needs no fonts
and conflicts with *Enemy Control*.
For the game debug menu, install `DbgFont14h.ccm` and `DbgFont14h.tpf` from
[Debug Menu and XML Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/253) into the game's
`dvdroot_ps4/font/` first. Startup rejects missing or empty font files instead of launching
the unsafe patch. Open it with the left touchpad / Tab; Backspace is the right touchpad.
Touch coordinates are forwarded from SDL gamepads; Back/Select emulates a left click on
pads without a touch surface. The port's settings menu remains Insert / L3+R3.

GPU occlusion queries still use synthetic pixel counters (`PixelPipeStatDump`), and
`IT_SET_PREDICATION` is unimplemented. Free camera allows visual investigation; it does
not implement GPU occlusion culling.

**Upscaler assets** (not included; FSR 3.1 needs none):

```bash
bash tools/fetch_fsr4_assets.sh      # FSR 4 v07 (MIT, built from AMD's source by Q2RTX)
# FSR 4.1.1, from your own AMD DLLs (e.g. OptiScaler's FSR4_LATEST), needs GE-Proton 10 or newer:
bash tools/fsr4cap/build_assets.sh <amd_fidelityfx_upscaler_dx12.dll> <amd_fidelityfx_loader_dx12.dll>
```

The FSR 4.1.1 build takes its tools from the system (MinGW GCC, CMake, Ninja, Python 3,
SPIRV-Tools, Git, umu-launcher) or from Nix, and the newest GE-Proton from Steam (or
`PROTONPATH`). On RDNA4 the capture hides FP8 cooperative matrices from vkd3d-proton so that the
DLL uses the variant bbport replays; this is not yet confirmed on RDNA4 hardware.

**AppImage** (Steam Deck): `bash build.sh && bash packaging/appimage.sh` →
`dist/Bloodborne-bbport-x86_64.AppImage`; data in `~/.local/share/bbport`, `--play` starts the
game without the launcher window (Game Mode). FSR 4.1.1 models are not packaged: build them
(see above) into `~/.local/share/bbport/fsr4_411` (`BB_PACKAGE_FSR411=1` bundles a local
`fsr4_411` into an AppImage for your own devices). On the Steam Deck pick the 1280×720 output (the
game is 16:9; on the 1280×800 screen it gets thin bars).

**Adding the AppImage to Steam** (*Add a Non-Steam Game*) needs no options; the compatibility tool
does not matter. (Steam preloads its overlay into every non-Steam game; the AppImage removes it
before its own programs start, so the Steam overlay is not shown in the game.) Where Steam
runs games without FUSE (NixOS: Steam's FHS sandbox; the AppImage then exits with *Cannot mount
AppImage*), set the launch options to

```
TMPDIR=$HOME/.cache APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1 NO_CLEANUP=1 %command%
```

The AppImage then unpacks itself (~2 GB, `~/.cache/appimage_extracted_*`) on the first start
(~10 s) and reuses that copy afterwards; a new AppImage version gets a new copy, the old one can
be deleted. Without `TMPDIR` it would unpack into Steam's `/tmp`, which is in RAM there. Add
` --play` after `%command%` to skip the launcher.

**NVIDIA in the AppImage:** startup discovers the host's installed 64-bit NVIDIA Vulkan ICD
and exposes its vendor libraries alongside the bundled AMD/Intel drivers. This keeps the
NVIDIA userspace driver matched to the host kernel module. Standard Linux distributions keep
these libraries under `/usr/lib*`; on NixOS the AppImage's internal `/nix/store` may hide them.
In that case copy the NVIDIA libraries into an accessible directory and set
`BB_NVIDIA_LIB_DIR=/path/to/libraries` (the NVIDIA manifest must also be accessible).
Explicit `VK_DRIVER_FILES`/`VK_ICD_FILENAMES` overrides are preserved. Diagnose drivers inside
the package with:

```bash
./Bloodborne-bbport-x86_64.AppImage --vulkan-info 2>&1 | tee bbport-vulkan.log
```

A user reported successful startup with FSR 3 on a GTX 1060 6GB (Fedora 44, NVIDIA
580.178.04); selecting FSR 4 caused a black window. Use FSR 3 on this configuration.

MangoHud is bundled in the AppImage; enable its checkbox in the launcher. If MangoHud is also
installed system-wide, or Steam's performance overlay is on (Steam Deck game mode), only one
overlay is drawn (two drew doubled, offset text).
When running from source, install MangoHud separately. A diagnostic launch with
`VK_LOADER_LAYERS_DISABLE=~implicit~` also disables MangoHud.

Useful variables: `BB_FRAME_STATS=1` (frame statistics, including a `Memory:` line: VRAM, GTT,
RSS, images and guest blocks in VRAM), `BB_GUEST_IN_PLACE=1` (the experimental PC memory model;
0, the 0.2 model, is the default), `BB_ANISO=N` (anisotropic filtering of scene textures; 16 by
default, 0 = the game's own),
`BB_GC_IDLE_SECONDS=N` / `BB_VRAM_IDLE_SECONDS=N` (how long unused textures / buffers stay in VRAM;
20 / 60), `BB_BREADCRUMBS=0` (no GPU breadcrumbs; with them a GPU hang names the draw or dispatch
it is stuck in), `BB_GPU_PROFILE=1` (GPU time per
pass), `BB_FSR4_PROFILE=1` (GPU time per FSR 4 pass), `BB_UPSCALER=taa|fsr3|fsr4|fsr411|off|none`,
`BB_FRAMES_AHEAD=N` (how many frames the GPU command thread may run ahead of the GPU; 1 by default,
0 = unbounded), `BB_PRESENT_THREAD=0` (present on the vblank thread, as before),
`BB_LIVE_RES=1` (live resolution changes instead of the startup patch for outputs other than 1080p),
`BB_PAD_RECORD=file` / `BB_PAD_REPLAY=file` (record a route with F9, replay it in scripted tests),
`BB_GC_BUDGET_MB=N` (texture cache budget, as on integrated GPUs), `BB_PRESENT_DUMP_TRIGGER=file`
with `BB_PRESENT_DUMP_COUNT=N` (dump N consecutive presented frames).

## Roadmap

- **Next patch:** the rest of the graphics renderer as translation instead of emulation (the
  model of Wine and DXVK): the game's GnmDriver calls translated directly into Vulkan, without
  emulating the PS4 command processor.
- The PC memory model on by default once it is stable on more GPUs (NVIDIA included).
- More CPU parallelism in GPU command processing (split the draw-recording stage further),
  scaling to all hardware threads — most important for the Steam Deck.
- Async compute for the upscaler (the frame is GPU-bound at 4K).
- XeSS (super resolution) and XeFG frame generation through a Wine helper sharing Vulkan
  memory (a memory-bridge prototype is in `tools/bridge_helper`); DLSS for NVIDIA users;
  inputs exposed so that OptiScaler-style mapping works.
- Frame generation (FSR 3.1 FG first), reactive and transparency masks for particles and fog.
- Fix the races in AMD's FSR 4.1.1 shaders at output widths that are not multiples of 64
  (e.g. 1600×900), as already done for the left-edge race in FSR 4 v07 at 1080p.
- Steam Deck validation of the AppImage; HDR output.
